## About
Since I’m a project-based learner, I’m currently diving into Golang by working on a project. This approach helps me immerse myself in Go and learn through hands-on experience.

## What to do?
- main functionalities (show, add, and delete tasks).
- read and write date to JSON file (I/O files).
- convert to CLI-based app version.
- make a web API version of it. **[not sure]**
